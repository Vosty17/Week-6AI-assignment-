# ESSAY QUESTIONS
### **Q1:** Explain how **Edge AI** reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example (e.g., autonomous drones).

Edge AI refers to unning algorithms directly on local devices (edge devices) rather than relying on cloud-based servers. This approach offers two key aadvantages over cloud-based AI: **reduced latency** and **enhanced privacy**.
## 1. Reduced Latency
In cloud-based AI, data is sent to remote servers for processing, introducing delays due to network transmission.

Edge AI processes data locally, eliminating the need for round-trip communication, which is critical for real-time applications.

**Example:** Autonomous drones require instant decision-making (e.g., obstacles avoidance). Edge AI allows them to process sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) on-board without waiting for cloud responses, ensuring faster reactions.

## 2. Enhanced privacy
Cloud-based AI requires transmitting sensitive data (e.g., video feeds, personal health metrics) over networks, increasing exposure to breaches.

Edge AI keeps data on-device, minimizing exposure.

**Example:** A surveillance drone with Edge AI can analyze footage locally and only send alerts (not raw video) to a central system, reducing privacy risks.

## Real-World Example:
**Autonomous Agricultural Drones** use Edge AI to analyze crop health in real time. Instead of sending images to the cloud, they process data on-device to detect pests/diseases instantly, improving efficiency while keeping farm data private.

### **Q2:** Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems. What industries could benefit most from Quantum AI?
## Aspect
**Computational Power:** **Classical AI** relies on binary bits (0/1) while **Quantum AI** Uses qubits (superposition & entanglement); excels at parallel processing.

## Aspect
**Optimization Speed:** **Classical AI** heuristics (eg. gradient descent) may get stuck while **quantum AI** Quantum annealing (e.g., D-Wave) explores multiple solutions simultaneously.

## Aspect
**Scalability:** **Classical AI** is limited by Moore’s Law; hardware bottlenecks while **Quantum AI** has potential for exponential speedup (e.g., Shor’s algorithm).

## Aspect
**Scalability:** **Classical AI** is well-established (e.g., deep learning) while **Quantum AI** in early-staeges it requires error correction

**Industries that could benefit from quantum AI are:**
1. **Pharmaceuticals:** Accelerating drug discovery by simulating molecular interactions.
2. **Finance:** Portfolio optimization, fraud detection, and risk modeling.
3. **Logistics:** Solving complex routing problems (e.g., supply chain optimization).
4. **Energy:** Grid optimization and materials science for better batteries.

**Example:** Volkswagen uses **quantum annealing** to optimize traffic flow in Lisbon, reducing congestion by calculating optimal routes faster than classical algorithms.

### **Q3:** Discuss the societal impact of **Human-AI collaboration** in healthcare. How might it transform roles like radiologists or nurses?
### Societal impact:
1. **Improved Diagnostics:** AI augments human judgment (e.g., IBM Watson analyzes medical literature to suggest treatments).

2. **Efficiency:** Automating administrative tasks (e.g., documentation) frees time for patient care.

3. **Accessibility:** AI-powered telemedicine extends healthcare to rural/underserved areas.

4. **Ethical Challenges:** Bias in training data may exacerbate disparities; accountability for errors remains debated.
### Transformation roles:
**Radiologists:**
- AI (e.g., DeepMind’s mammography analysis) flags anomalies, allowing radiologists to focus on complex cases.
- Shift from manual scanning to overseeing AI outputs + patient consultations.

**Nurses:**
- Wearable AI monitors patients’ vitals, alerting nurses to emergencies early.
- More time for empathetic care rather than routine checks.

**Example:** At **Mayo Clinic**, AI assists radiologists in detecting early-stage tumors with 95% accuracy, improving outcomes while reducing workload.
