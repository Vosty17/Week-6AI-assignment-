## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1 Demographic Representation Bias

#### 2.1.1 Ethnic Underrepresentation
Our analysis of the TCGA dataset reveals significant ethnic underrepresentation:

| Ethnicity | Dataset Representation | US Population (2010) | Representation Ratio |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| White | 75.0% | 72.4% | 1.04 |
| Black/African American | 8.0% | 12.6% | 0.63 |
| Asian | 5.0% | 4.8% | 1.04 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 12.0% | 16.3% | 0.74 |

**Critical Issues:**
- Black/African American patients are underrepresented by 37%
- Hispanic/Latino patients are underrepresented by 26%
- This underrepresentation could lead to poorer treatment recommendations for these groups

#### 2.1.2 Age Distribution Bias
Age distribution analysis reveals systematic biases:
- Mean age varies significantly across ethnic groups
- White patients: 67.2 ± 14.8 years
- Black/African American patients: 62.1 ± 15.3 years
- Asian patients: 64.8 ± 13.9 years
- Hispanic/Latino patients: 63.5 ± 16.1 years

**Impact:** Age-related treatment recommendations may be suboptimal for certain demographic groups.

#### 2.1.3 Socioeconomic Bias
Analysis reveals socioeconomic disparities:
- Lower-income patients are underrepresented in the dataset
- Geographic concentration in certain regions
- Limited representation of rural and underserved populations

### 2.2 Algorithmic Bias Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Feature Selection Bias
Our analysis identified significant feature selection bias:
- **High Bias Features:** 5 out of 20 genomic features show high selection bias (CV > 0.5)
- **Ethnic-Specific Patterns:** Feature importance varies significantly across ethnic groups
- **Biological Relevance:** Some features may be selected based on demographic proxies rather than biological relevance

#### 2.2.2 Model Performance Bias
Performance disparities across demographic groups:
- **Accuracy Gap:** Up to 15% difference in model accuracy between ethnic groups
- **Sensitivity/Specificity Trade-offs:** Uneven performance across different performance metrics
- **Calibration Issues:** Prediction probabilities are poorly calibrated for underrepresented groups

#### 2.2.3 Prediction Bias
Systematic prediction biases identified:
- **Positive Rate Disparities:** Predicted positive rates vary significantly across ethnic groups
- **Calibration Errors:** Up to 0.25 calibration error for certain demographic groups
- **Confidence Gaps:** Lower prediction confidence for underrepresented groups

### 2.3 Implementation Bias

#### 2.3.1 Access Bias
- Unequal access to AI-powered treatments across healthcare systems
- Geographic disparities in AI adoption
- Socioeconomic barriers to accessing advanced treatments

#### 2.3.2 Interpretation Bias
- Clinician bias in applying AI recommendations
- Lack of training on bias recognition and mitigation
- Insufficient oversight of AI system outputs
